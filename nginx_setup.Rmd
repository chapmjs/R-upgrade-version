Now Iâ€™m interested in creating a new subdomain (rstudio.nvsgroup.org) to create/edit build apps online.
go to myhosting.com, login, and create a new CNAME (rstudio.nvsgroup.org) that points to systemsresearch.linkpc.net (dynamic dns)
then create a new certificate for rstudio.nvsgroup.org, and setup a new location in the nginx config file

also need to close unused ports on home router.
